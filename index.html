            <p>In fair Southampton, where the great ships sail,<br>
            A young maiden named Rose did dwell.<br>
            She was of noble birth, but her heart was frail,<br>
            For she was betrothed to a man she did not love.</p>

            <p class="m-8">
            One day, on the maiden voyage of the Titanic,<br>
            Rose met a young artist named Jack.<br>
            He was poor and uncouth, but he was kind and gentle,<br>
            And he saw the beauty in Rose that no one else could see.<br></p>

            <p>They fell in love, but their love was forbidden.<br>
            Rose's mother would never approve of Jack,<br>
            And the Titanic was a ship of class and privilege.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="m-8">
            But Jack and Rose could not deny their love.<br>
            They snuck away together, and they found a place to be alone.<br>
            They kissed in the moonlight, and they made promises to each other.<br>
            </p>

            <p>But their happiness was not to last.<br>
            On the night of April 14, 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg.<br>
            The ship began to sink, and chaos erupted.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="m-8">
            Jack and Rose were separated in the crowd.<br>
            Jack tried to save Rose, but he was too late.<br>
            The Titanic sank, and Jack was lost.<br>
            </p>

            <p>Rose survived, but she was heartbroken.<br>
            She had lost the love of her life, and she would never be the same.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="m-8">
            But she never forgot Jack.<br>
            She kept his memory alive in her heart,<br>
            And she knew that their love would never die.<br>
            </p>
